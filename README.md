## Hey there!
This repository contains the source code for a model submission for the first module of DevSoc's GameDev Vertical. 
> [!NOTE] 
> This was built in Unity Editor `v6000.0.64f1` (LTS), which has quite a few differences from the editor used in the provided playlist. Since the playlist is quite dated (>8 years old), I would personally suggest to learn how to use a recent LTS version (such as the one used in this repo.)

Some key differences include:
- Usage of the new input system in favor of Input Manager
- UI differences
- TBA

The project itself will be slightly different from the one made in the playlist in terms of mechanics:
- Infinitely long levels
- Procedural generation of obstacles
- Obstacle "sets" in favor of individual obstacles
- The player doesn't move, the obstacle sets move towards the player instead
